%TODO: INSERT MORE HERE
Having stated the problem to be solved in the problem statement document, Team 8 
will develop the Genetic Cars project to solve it. The following document 
details the development plan for Team 8's Genetic Cars project..

\section{Team Meeting Plan}

\subsection{Overview}
\textcolor{red}{ Use your team name rather than \textit{Team 8}. - CM} \\
Team 8's meetings will resemble a modified version of daily scrum meetings; 
however, instead of holding daily scrum meetings, they will be held weekly. Team 
8 will structure 3 meetings each week, with the first meeting requiring full 
attendance of all members, and the remaining 2 requiring members to attend as 
needed. The first meeting will resemble the daily scrum meeting, while the 
latter two meetings will resolve issues and difficulties mentioned in the former 
meeting.

\subsection{Meeting Structure}
Team meetings will be held three times per week: on Monday from 7:00PM to 
8:00PM, on Wednesday from 8:30AM to 10:30AM, and on Fridays from 2:30PM to 
4:30PM. On Mondays, the team meetings will be held in a meeting room at McMaster 
University. Kelvin Lin will be responsible for booking the meeting rooms, and 
releasing the meeting location 1 week before the meeting date. The meetings on 
Wednesday and Friday will be held in ITB 236.

The meetings on Mondays will be used to aggregate the achievements and 
difficulties of the previous week, and to plan for the upcoming week. Members 
will be presented with the opportunity to discuss any achievements and 
difficulties they encountered while working on their tasks. A list of 
difficulties will be created; however, there will not be an in-depth 
investigation or 
resolution of the aforementioned difficulty. For each issue mentioned, a list of 
team members who are qualified to solve the problem will be created, and a 
member from that list will be chosen to investigate that problem. A meeting will 
be held on the subsequent Wednesday or Friday in order to discuss the resolution 
or further issues pertaining to that problem. The meetings on Monday will 
conclude with a list of tasks each member is responsible for in the upcoming 
week.

The meetings on Wednesdays and Fridays will be used to address specific 
decisions pertaining to the project deliverables. Topics will include making 
specific design decisions, resolving issues mentioned on Monday's meeting, 
resolving any issues discovered throughout the week, and addressing any 
intergroup problems. To account for in-lab activities, the meetings will be 
divided into sub-meetings, and members will only be required to attend meetings 
that concern aspects of the tasks that they are working on. Members can work on 
the in-lab activities when they are not in a meeting. 

\subsection{Components of Meetings}
Key components of team meetings include the chair, the agenda, the scribe, and 
the meeting minutes.

\subsubsection{The Chair}
The chair will be responsible for organizing the topics to be discussed at the 
meeting and orchestrating the flow of the meeting. Before each meeting, the 
chair is responsible for creating an agenda for the meeting. During the 
meetings, the chair has an obligation to maintain a neutral front; the chair 
exert his authority to favour one side of an issue over the other side of the 
issue. However, the chair will have the authority to defer topics that threaten 
the overall structure of the meeting: if a topic exceeds the allotted time for 
discussion or if an unforeseen issue arises from a predetermined topic, the 
chair has the authority to defer the topic to a future meeting. The chair will 
not have the authority to veto decisions made by the team, nor will the chair's 
opinion be valued more than the other members. At the end of each meeting, the 
chair is responsible for establishing the next meeting date and making the 
appropriate reservations for a meeting space. Unless otherwise noted, Kelvin Lin 
will be the chair of the meetings.

\subsubsection{The Agenda}
The agenda is a written document to be written in \LaTeX. It details the topics 
to be covered in an upcoming meeting. At a minimum, it must provide a numbered 
list of topics to be covered, as well as a brief summary of each topic. The 
summary can be as simple as a point list. The agenda should be released to all 
team members 
before each meeting.

\subsubsection{The Scribe}
The scribe of the meeting will be responsible for taking appropriate notes at 
the meeting. Before each meeting, the scribe must prepare the appropriate 
equipment needed to take notes. This could include, but is not limited to, 
laptops, notebooks, pens, pencils, and paper. If possible, the scribe should 
obtain a copy of the agenda from the chair. During each meeting, the scribe has 
the obligation to keep accurate, unbiased notes that provide a faithful 
representation of the meeting. All events and decisions must be recorded in a 
manner so that they can be referenced in the future. Attendance, and future 
meeting dates should also be recorded. After each meeting, the scribe is 
responsible for formalizing the notes into meeting minutes. Unless otherwise 
noted, Jin Liu will be the scribe of the meetings.

\subsubsection{The Meeting Minutes}
The meeting minutes is a written document to be written in \LaTeX. It is a 
formalization of the notes taken by the scribe during each meeting. The meeting 
minutes can be appended to the corresponding meeting agenda of the same date. At 
a minimum, the meeting minutes must contain three sections: a section to detail 
the key points of the conversation during each topic of discussion, a summary of 
the key decisions made during each meeting, and a list of tasks each member is 
responsible for before the next meeting. The meeting minutes should be released 
to all team members before the start of the next meeting.

\subsection{Emergency Provisions}
In the unlikely event of an emergency, impromptu meetings can be held on 
Thursdays 12:30PM to 1:30PM, at a location to be determined. All members are 
expected to be present at emergency meetings. Depending on the urgency of the 
meeting, an agenda for the meeting may not exist; however, the scribe will still 
be responsible for taking notes and releasing meeting minutes after the meeting. 
Topics at emergency meetings will only pertain to issues at-hand: that is, no 
long-term planning will be done at emergency meetings unless otherwise required 
by the deliverable. If required, additional meetings can be scheduled through 
the Facebook Messenger platform on an as-needed basis.

\section{Team Communication Plan}
\subsection{Online Platforms}
Team 8 will communicate with a variety of online platforms and in-person 
meetings. While the structure of in-person meetings is described above, the 
online platforms used include Facebook, GitLab, and Telephone/Internet Phone.

\subsubsection{Facebook}
Facebook offers an instant messaging service called Messenger, which will serve 
as the team's primary form of online communication. Facebook offers message 
logging, real-time communication, and private messaging, all of which are 
convenient features for the team. All message logs are recorded by Facebook, 
which can be referenced in the future. Moreover, Facebook messages are delivered 
in real time, so members can stay updated on the status of the project. Private 
messaging will also allow members to discuss aspects of the project that would 
not interest the third member.

\subsubsection{GitLab}
GitLab is a repository management system that allows users to version their 
code. Team 8 will use GitLab to store the project and any relevant 
documentation. GitLab will be used because it provides a form of separation of 
concerns for each member, while allowing for concurrent access to the code. 
Members can add to the code repository without interference from other updates. 
GitLab also allows members to have local copies of the code for experimentation. 
Accordingly, GitLab will be used to manage documents used by Team 8.

\subsubsection{Phone}
The phone provides real-time voice-to-voice communication between members. The 
phone will be used for emergency contact purposes. Such emergencies include 
power outages, last minute changes in plans, and last minute technical errors. 
The phone will be used for emergency purposes because it provides synchronized 
communication between the members: the communicating members are expected to 
respond as soon as communication ends from the other member.

\section{Team Member Roles}
Team 8 will have the following roles: team lead, technology expert, graphics 
expert, theory expert, qualitative testing expert, and quantitative testing 
expert. The assignment and descriptions of each role follow.

\subsection{Assignment of Roles}
The following table shows the assignment of roles in Team 8.

	\caption{Team 8 Role Assignments}
\end{table}

\subsection{Description of Roles}

\subsubsection{Team Lead}
The team lead is responsible for the overall management of the project. The team 
lead is responsible for ensuring that all deliverables are made to 
specification and on time. To accomplish this, the team lead must be sensitive 
to the member's skills and abilities, and partition tasks to allow all of the 
other members to succeed and to develop new skills. The team lead shall ensure 
that every member is aware of the tasks that need to be done, and what their 
role is on the team. The team lead is also responsible for facilitating 
communication to external parties by representing the voice of the team.

\subsubsection{Technology Expert}
The technology expert is responsible for maintaining current knowledge on 
general aspects of the technology used. The technology expert will serve as the 
first point of contact for any technical problems encountered with, but not 
limited to, Git, HTML5, JavaScript, \LaTeX, GanttProject, Doxygen, and Karma. 
The technology expert will be in charge of general troubleshooting, and he will 
redirect members to the appropriate experts when required. Moreover, the 
technology expert will be responsible for researching new technologies that can 
be used for the project.

\subsubsection{Graphics Expert}
The graphics expert is responsible for maintaining current knowledge on the 
algorithms and technology needed to implement the graphics for the project. The 
graphics expert shall learn all tools necessary in order to create a graphical 
interface for the project, and he will be responsible for communicating this 
knowledge to other members of the team in a manner comprehensible by both 
members with and without prior technical knowledge. The graphics expert will 
also be responsible for experimenting with new graphical technologies, and 
spearheading the graphics-related implementation initiatives of the project. 

\subsubsection{Theory Expert}
The theory expert will be responsible for maintaining current knowledge of the 
theory needed to comprehend the algorithms used in the project. The theory 
expert will be responsible for understanding theory behind the physics, learning 
algorithm, and graphics. The theory expert will be responsible for finding any 
references to published text when needed. Moreover, the theory expert will be 
responsible for communicating this knowledge to other members of the team in a 
manner comprehensible by both members with and without prior technical 
knowledge.

\subsubsection{Qualitative Testing Expert}
The qualitative testing expert will be responsible for maintaining current 
knowledge of qualitative testing methodologies within the scope of the project. 
The qualitative testing expert will be responsible for leading any qualitative 
tests including but not limited to market research and observation, in-person 
and online surveys, discussion/focus groups, and code review sessions. Such 
tasks may involve partitioning tasks for each initiative and assigning the tasks 
to the 
appropriate member. Moreover, the qualitative testing expert will be responsible 
for reporting any results to the group and making recommendations based on the 
results to improve the projects.

\subsubsection{Quantitative Testing Expert}
The quantitative testing expert will be responsible for maintaining current 
knowledge of quantitative testing methodologies within the scope of the project. 
Before the implementation of the project, the quantitative testing expert shall 
familiarize himself with different tools used to test the agreed-upon 
technologies. The quantitative testing expert will be responsible for leading 
any quantitative testing initiatives including unit testing, integration 
testing, system testing, automated testing, and manual testing. Such tasks may 
involve partitioning tasks for each initiative and assigning the tasks to the 
appropriate member. Moreover, the quantitative testing expert will be 
responsible for reporting any results to the group and making recommendations 
based on the results to improve the project.

\section{Git Workflow Plan}
Team 8 will utilize a feature-branch workflow plan. 

\subsection{Feature-branch Overview}
The feature-branch workflow branch is a Git workflow plan that utilizes 
different branches to implement different feature of the programs. Once a 
particular feature of the program is completed, its branch will be merged with 
the master branch. Labels will be used to tag submission files, while milestones 
will be used in order to signal any major revisions on the master branch.

\subsection{Rationale}
In selecting a Git workflow plan, Team 8 wanted a workflow that would provide 
maximum support for separation of concerns, while guaranteeing that there will 
always be a working version of the project easily assessable. Such workflow 
would simplify both the development, testing, and deployment efforts of the 
team. A high level of separations of concerns would allow multiple members to 
code concurrently without interference from code changes from other members. 
Members can also test their code using the master branch as a driver. This is a 
valid approach as any functional code on the master branch would have already 
been tested. The second requirement of the Team's desired workflow plan 
guarantees this by specifying that only functional versions of the project are 
to be committed to the master branch. 

The feature-branch workflow plan fully satisfies the requirements mentioned 
above. It supports separation of concerns by placing each feature of the program 
on a separate branch. Each branch will stem from a node on the master branch, 
allowing each branch to have an independent copy of the previously functional 
code. This will allow members to write new features in isolation, without having 
to account for continuous changes made by other members. The master branch can 
also serve as a driver for unit testing, and for regression testing. 
Accordingly, the feature-branch workflow was chosen.

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}
The proof of concept demonstration will consist of three independent components 
that resemble simplified versions of the final product: the car model, the 
genetic algorithm (GA) module, and the graphics simulation. 

\subsection{The Car Model}
The Car Model will be a JavaScript module that demonstrates two things: the car 
is representable as a data structure, and the Box2D API can be integrated into 
the project. 

\subsubsection{The Car}
The car in this project is composed of 8 vectors attached to a central point. 
The 
tips of the vectors are connected to form triangles. Each car contains 8 
vectors. In addition, each car can have up to 8 wheels. Each wheel has a radius, 
an axle angle, and a vertex. Two wheels can lie on the same vertex. Each car 
will also have mass, which will be a randomly generated value between two 
predetermined numbers.

\subsubsection{The Deliverable}
The Car Model will likely be modelled as a JSON object, or a customized 
equivalent, with properties such as the coordinates for each of its 8 vectors; 
the vertex, axle angle, and radius of each of its 8 wheels; a boolean for each 
of its wheels to indicate whether the wheel exists. A script to test the JSON 
model will also be created. This script will access each field of the car and 
output its value in text to the console. The script will also use the Box2D API 
to create the corresponding vectors for the car, and if it is successful, then 
it will print "true" to the console.

\subsubsection{The Risks}
The Box2D API poses the most significant risk for the car model. The Box2D API 
defines the car entity in terms that can be used with many physics equations, 
which is important for calculating the fitness function of the car. In the event 
that the Box2D API prooves to be infeasible for Team 8, alternate arrangemets 
will have to be made in order to complete the project: the team will resort to 
using basic kinematics equations to calculate the fitness function instead of 
using the API. A possible drawback to this approach would be that the members of 
Team 8 are generally unfamiliar with Newtonian mechanics, so external assistance 
would be required. Tentatively, the team plans to consult with Dr. Spencer Smith 
during his office hours should this assistance be required.

\subsection{The Genetic Algorithm}
The purpose for implementing the GA is to demonstrate its practicality to 
the project. In order for this portion to succeed, it must be able to select for 
the top n cars given an array of cars, n, and fitness scores as input; crossover 
the genes of these cars; and mutate the genes of the offspring.

\subsubsection{Genetic Algorithm Overview}
GAs attempt to find near-optimal solutions to problems with incomplete or 
imperfect information by emulating the process of natural solution. In this 
project, the GA will be used in order to find the best car in terms of the 
distance driven on an predetermined road. First, the GA will select for the top 
n cars based on their fitness scores. Then, the GA will use the fields of the 
car as genes, and swapping them in order to simulate reproduction. This project 
will do this by randomly selecting two fields and two cars, and swapping those 
two fields such that the first car will have the two fields from the second car 
and the second car will have two fields from the first car. Finally, to finish 
creating the offsprings, the GA will randomly change some of the fields at a 
frequency based on a mutation likelihood between 0\% and 100\%. 

\subsubsection{The Deliverable}
The deliverable will consist of a JavaScript file that consists of at least 
three functions: selectNextGeneration(cars:Car[], fitnessScores: Integer, n: 
Integer), crossoverOffsprings(cars: Car[], population: Integer, n:Integer), and 
mutateOffsprings(cars: Car[], mutationFactor: Integer, n: Integer). The 
selectNextGeneration function will take an array of cars and their fitness 
scores, and return an array containing the top n cars. The crossoverOffsprings 
function will take an array of cars, and randomly select parent cars (from the 
first n element in the cars array) to cross over their genes, such that the 
number of cars in the cars array equals the population. The mutateOffsprings 
function will randomly mutate the fields of the offsprings by a given mutation 
factor.

This file will be demonstrated using another script with hardcoded values for 
cars. The script will first run the selectNextGeneration function, and print the 
fields of the top n cars to the console. Then, the script will crossover the top 
n cars using the crossoverOffsprings function, and print their fields to the 
console, as well as which fields and cars were used to make the swap. Finally, 
the mutateOffsprings method will be used to mutate the cars and then the fields 
of the cars that mutated as well as their previous fields on separate lines.

\subsubsection{The Risks}
The adaptation of algorithm itself presents a significant risk for this project. 
Any assumptions made in the original algorithm will carry over to the project 
where those assumptions may not hold to be true.  Furhtermore, if any errors 
exist in the GA code, the final result will be negatively effected. To avoid 
this risk, the original algorithm will be tested in an isolated enviroment to 
ensure its general accuracy. The coded algorithm will also be tested in 
isolation of the program's other components to ensure it is properly implemented 
in Javascript. This is feasible due to Team 8's object oriented programming 
approach to this project.

\subsection{The Graphics}
The purpose of the graphics demonstration is to show competency in the 
technologies required to create the graphical interface for the project. The 
final deliverable will consist of a simple 3-vector car moving horizontally 
across the screen over a dynamically generated road, with a camera centred on 
the car.

\subsubsection{Graphics Overview}
The graphics for this project consists of multiple cars displayed on the screen, 
moving horizontally over a road, with the camera focused on the fastest car in 
the population. The user interface also allows users to modify certain 
parameters of the GA, and view the improvement of the cars over several 
generations. 

\subsubsection{The Deliverable}
The deliverable for the proof of concept demonstration will be a simplified 
version of the final user interface. It will consist of a HTML5 canvas with a 
dynamically generated line representing the road near the bottom of the canvas. 
A random car will be generated with 3 vectors (1 triangle) and 2 wheels (2 
circles). The car will move horizontally across the screen indefinitely. A 
camera will also focus on the car, so that the center of the car will always be 
at the center of the screen.

\subsubsection{The Risks}
\textcolor{red}{Include a specific online resource to use so all team members have a common baseline understanding - CM} \\
The implementation of the Javascript graphics language will present a 
significant risk for this project. Team 8 has more experience with C++ and Java 
graphics packages, and it is possible that the adaptation of Javascript will 
prove more difficult then initially believed. Team 8's graphics and technology 
experts have arranged to minimize this risk by educating themselves on 
Javascript's graphics functionality extensively through online resources and 
peers familiar with Javascript.

\section{Technology}

This project will use technology that all group members are already familiar 
with on a basic level. The project itself will be coded in Java Script, however 
all group members understand that Java may be used if JavaScript proves too 
difficult to use for this project. All group members are familiar with both of 
these languages and no further learning will be required. Team 8's graphics 
expert is also adept at creating graphics in JavaScript. Written reports and 
documents will be generated through Latex, a technology being taught in the 3xa3 
course, and documents and reports will be shared through Git, another technology 
being taught in the 3xa3 course. The technology expert will ensure that all 
group members are aware of how to use these technologies. Testing will be aided 
by the use of Java’s built in unit test functionality. Dox will serve as the 
primary document generator, and QUnit will serve as the means of automated 
testing.

\subsection{JavaScript}

JavaScript as a programming language is used for web applications. JavaScript is 
the ideal programming language for this project. Member's of Team 8 are familiar 
with JavaScript, and Team 8's graphics 
expert believes that JavScript will work best for his role. The final project 
will also closely 
resemble a standard web page in design. Finally, since the original basis for 
the 
project is also written in JavaScript, the original source code code can be more 
easily used for 
inspiration and troubleshooting.

%%\subsubsection{Possible switch to Java}
%%
%%While Team 8 is very familiar with JavaScript, it is possible that JavaScript 
%%may reveal itself to be unsuitable for this project. In the event that this 
%%occurs, Team 8 is well prepared to transition to the Java programming 
%%language, 
%%as it is one with which we are more familiar. Java was chosen as a back-up 
%%language as it is the programming language that team 8 is the most familiar 
%%with 
%%and is very easy to convert to from Java Script so that we do not lose 
%%progress 
%%already made. The need for a switch from the Java Script programming language 
%%is 
%%believed to be highly unlikely however, and this is merely a back-up 
%%contingency.
%%

\subsection{\LaTeX}

\LaTeX will be used to generate documents for this project. \LaTeX's ability for 
multiple team members to effect changes simultaneously and its versatility 
across platforms makes it ideal for this project. As of September 28 2016 all 
team members have acquired a working knowledge of how \LaTeX functions, and it 
is 
believed that no further education will be required. If any such education is 
necessary the TAs and the Latex tutorial found online will be Team 8's go-to 
instructors. 

\subsection{GitLab}

GitLab will be used to share and store documents for this project. More 
information on GitLab and how it will be used for this project can be found in 
sections 2.1.2 and in the Git Workflow Plan found in section 4. All team 8 
members are familiar with GitLab and how it functions. 

\subsection{Dox}
Dox will be used to generate documents. Dox is a JavaScript documentation 
generator written with Node available on GitHub. It generates a JSON 
representation from the comments in the code, which can be passed to a template 
in order to generate a website similar to JavaDocs. Its well documented nature 
makes it a good choice for this project. The original source of Dox can be found 
at
\href{https://github.com/tj/dox}{https://github.com/tj/dox}.

\subsection{QUnit}
QUnit will be used for automated testing for this project. Its similarity to 
JUnit, an automated testing software for Java, means that it will be easy to 
learn, and its cross platform flexibility means that it is unlikely to cause 
technical problems. The original source of QUnit can be found at
\href{https://qunitjs.com/}{https://gunitjs.com}

\section{Coding Style}

Code will be styled primarily as has been taught by the software engineering 
program at McMaster University. Team 8 will undertake an object oriented 
programming approach to achieve maximum modularity and information hiding. The 
team shall also ensure that the code meets several aesthetic guidelines outlined 
here. All code is to be well commented, with comments being placed before the 
code. Comments are to be written with the understanding that they should be 
concise and easy to comprehend by outside parties. To satisify these 
requirements, Mozilla Developer Network's coding style will be adopted by the 
team. 

\subsection{Mozilla Developer Network}

Mozilla Developer Network will be Team 8's default coding style. It contains 
subsections specifically for JavaScript, the programming language of choice for 
this project.  The guidelines for this coding style can be found at
\href{https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer\_guide/Coding\_Style}{https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer\_guide/Coding\_Style}.
