		Requirement \#: 1 & Requirement Type: Functional \\

	\textbf{Description:} Each car must be composed of at least \textit{v} vectors. 
	\\
	\textbf{Rationale:}  This requirement manages the complexity of the car model, 
	allowing for realistic distribution of traits among members of a population. 
	That is, this prevents large cars from being generated and using an excessive 
	amount of memory. \\
	\textbf{Originator:} Kelvin Lin\\

	\textit{number\_of\_vertices} wheels. \\
	\textbf{Rationale:}  The wheels must be attached to the car via a vertex between 
	two connecting vectors. This requirement ensures that no redundant or unused 
	wheels will be generated.\\
	\textbf{Originator:} Kelvin Lin\\
	\textbf{Fit Criterion:} No car generated within population \textit{p} shall be

	\textbf{Description:} The center of each wheel generated must be attached to a 
	vertex formed by connecting vectors. \\
	\textbf{Rationale:}  Wheels cannot be floating on or around the car. This 
	requirement ensures visual coherency by requiring wheels to be attached to the 
	car model. Knowing the center of the wheel will also allow the physics engine to 
	calculate the torque and distance that the car travelled.\\

	\\
	\textbf{Rationale:} In order to have realistic physical simulations of car 
	models, the mass of each car must have an upper limit. An upper limit reduces 
	the possibility of type incompatibility with certain APIs. Additionally, it 
	ensures that the mass of each car is encoded using a known number of bits.\\

	a result of restarting the application. \\

first encounter with the product, a majority of representative users shall, 
without enticement, agree that they feel they would want to utilize the product 
and that they would learn about Genetic Algorithms by using the product. 
Representative users should also feel that they can trust the product.

\subsection{Usability and Humanity Requirements}

\subsubsection{Ease of Use Requirements}

The product shall be easy for anybody over the age of 6 to use. The product 
shall not expect the user to remember anything about the product given multiple 
uses. The product shall make the user want to use it and to show the product to 
their friends/family/etc.. The product shall be used by people with no training 
or education except for a basic knowledge of the English language and the most 
very basic functions of a computer, such as how to navigate to a web-site and 
how to enter inputs when prompted to do so. A representative sample of users 
shall be able to successfully complete a given set of tasks with the product 
within a specified period of time to be determined at the time of the sample. 
The representative sample shall also show a willingness to show the product to 
others.

product shall be able to be used by these users with no training before use. A 
representative sample of users shall be able to successfully complete a given 
set of tasks with the product within a specified period of time to be determined 
at the time of the sample.

interest by the user following an input, which shall be a period of time no 
longer then five seconds. The initialization of the product shall be no longer

\subsubsection{Integrity Requirements}

\subsubsection{Privacy Requirements}

\subsection{Cultural Requirements}

\subsection{Legal Requirements}

\subsection{Health and Safety Requirements}

This section is not in the original Volere template, but health and safety are
issues that should be considered for every engineering project.

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}
Not applicable for this project.

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}

\subsubsection{Ready-Made Product}
Similar solutions to Grate's Genetic Cars already exists, notably BoxCar2D 
(boxcar2d.com/) and Rednuht's Genetic Cars (rednuht.org/genetic\_cars\_2/). Both 
products demonstrate the effect of genetic algorithms through evolving cars by 
selecting for the longest distance travel. They differ in that BoxCar2D displays 
one car at a time, whereas Rednuht's Genetic Cars displays all of the cars in 
one generation at once. They both allow users to adjust parameters of the 
genetic algorithm in order to observe the effects of the algorithm. They both 
show the performance of the cars over time.

\subsubsection{Reusable Components}
The Box2D API and the D3 API can both be reused in Grate's Genetic Cars. The 
Box2D API provides functionality such as Vectors and Polygons that can be used 
to model the car. The D3 API provides visualization functionality that can be 
used to visualize the performance of cars over time. These APIs provide 
functionality external to the core functionality of Grate's Genetic Cars, which 
will make them valuable assets as Grate will not have to reimplement these APIs.

\subsubsection{Products That Can Be Copied}
Rednuht's Genetic Cars is licensed under the author's custom license which 
grants others the right to reuse his code as part of their solution. 
Furthermore, both BoxCar2D and Rednuht's Genetic Cars have released their 
algorithms in some form: BoxCar2D through visuals and text, and Rednuht's 
Genetic Cars through source code. Grate's Genetic Cars can draw inspiration from 
these sources in implementing a new innovative solution to teaching genetic 
algorithms.

\subsection{New Problems}

\subsubsection{Potential User Problems}
Users may experience fatigue from prolong use of the product. Symptoms of 
fatigue can include eyestrain, dizziness, nausea, muscle pain, or general 
discomfort. To prevent fatigue, users should take periodic breaks when using the 
program for prolonged periods of time. However, fatigue should not pose a 
significant risk for this project, as the target audience for Grate's Genetic 
Cars is older teenagers and adults who have prior experience using computers and 
are  knowledgeable about the health concerns associated with prolong use of 
computers.

Users with epilepsy or prior history of seizures may also experience seizures or 
blackouts while using the product. Symptoms of seizures may include convulsions, 
eye or muscle twitching, loss of awareness, altered vision, involuntary 
movements, and disorientation. However, this risk is not significant as the risk 
of having a seizure from light flashes or patterns is low (about 1 in 4000), and 
the likelihood of experiencing a seizure can be reduced through simple steps. 
Users can reduce the risk of experience seizures while using the product if they 
sit or stand away from the screen, use the smallest screen possible, use the 
product in a well lit room, take frequent breaks, and refrain from using the 
product if tired.

\subsubsection{Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation Environment that 
May Inhibit the New Product}
Not applicable for this project.

\subsubsection{Follow-up Problems}
The implementation environment may become depreciated before the completion of 
the project, and the platforms the product is built for may no longer support 
the product after completion of implementation. This is a significant risk as 
modern programming languages and operating platforms are constantly evolving; 
however, this risk can be mitigated through writing maintainable code that can 
be converted to new standards as they arise.

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
Not applicable for this project.

\subsection{Risks}
The Box2D API poses the most signiﬁcant risk for the car model. The Box2D 
API deﬁnes the car entity in terms that can be used with many physics 
equations, which is important for calculating the ﬁtness function of the 
car. In the event that the Box2D API proves to be infeasible for Team 8, 
alternate arrangements will have to be made in order to complete the
project: the team will resort to using basic kinematics equations to calculate 
the ﬁtness function instead of using the API. A possible drawback to this 
approach would be that the members of Team 8 are generally unfamiliar with 
Newtonian mechanics, so external assistance would be required. 

\subsection{Costs}
There will be no cost at all since all the software (Latex editor, code 
complier etc.) and web-hosting are free. 

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
The user documents will be simple and efficient for our project since this 
project will not ask the user to do many things. The main responsibility for 
training documentation is letting user familiar with the start button, reset 
button and output table.

\subsection{Waiting Room}
Audio effect is expected to be add to this project.

\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}
Good structure and design for this project.
