%REQUIREMENT #1
\begin{reqbox}
%
\begin{tabular}{cc}
Requirement \#: 1 & Requirement Type: Functional \\
\end{tabular} \\
%
\textbf{Description:} The product must generate at least \textit{s} car samples 
per generation. \\
\textbf{Rationale:}  GAs improve by having a large number of samples 
(representing members in a population) intermix traits. This requirement allows 
the GA to work by guaranteeing that a sufficient sample will be present at all 
times.\\
\textbf{Originator:} Kelvin Lin\\
\textbf{Fit Criterion:} Given a user generated input, \textit{s}, the program 
should generate \textit{s} cars for each generation.\\
%  
\textbf{Supporting Materials:} JavaScript \\
\textbf{History:} Created October 7\textsuperscript{th}, 2016

\end{reqbox}

%REQUIREMENT #2
\begin{reqbox}
%
\begin{tabular}{cc}
Requirement \#: 2 & Requirement Type: Functional \\
\end{tabular} \\
%
\textbf{Description:} Each car must be composed of at least \textit{v} vectors. 
\\
\textbf{Rationale:}  This requirement manages the complexity of the car model, 
allowing for realistic distribution of traits among members of a population. 
That is, this prevents large cars from being generated and using an excessive 
amount of memory. \\
\textbf{Originator:} Kelvin Lin\\
\textbf{Fit Criterion:} No car generated within population \textit{p} shall be 
composed of more than \textit{v} vectors.\\
%  
\textbf{Supporting Materials:} JavaScript \\
\textbf{History:} Created October 7\textsuperscript{th}, 2016
%
\end{reqbox}

\newpage

%REQUIREMENT #3
\begin{reqbox}
%
\begin{tabular}{cc}
Requirement \#: 3 & Requirement Type: Functional \\
\end{tabular} \\
%
\textbf{Description:} Each car may not have more than 
\textit{number\_of\_vertices} wheels. \\
\textbf{Rationale:}  The wheels must be attached to the car via a vertex between 
two connecting vectors. This requirement ensures that no redundant or unused 
wheels will be generated.\\
\textbf{Originator:} Kelvin Lin\\
\textbf{Fit Criterion:} No car generated within population \textit{p} shall be 
composed of more than \textit{number\_of\_vertices} wheels.\\
%  
\textbf{Supporting Materials:} JavaScript \\
\textbf{History:} Created October 7\textsuperscript{th}, 2016
%
\end{reqbox}

%REQUIREMENT #4
\begin{reqbox}
%
\begin{tabular}{cc}
Requirement \#: 4 & Requirement Type: Functional \\
\end{tabular} \\
%
\textbf{Description:} The center of each wheel generated must be attached to a 
vertex formed by connecting vectors. \\
\textbf{Rationale:}  Wheels cannot be floating on or around the car. This 
requirement ensures visual coherency by requiring wheels to be attached to the 
car model. Knowing the center of the wheel will also allow the physics engine to 
calculate the torque and distance that the car travelled.\\
\textbf{Originator:} Kelvin Lin\\
\textbf{Fit Criterion:} Each wheel displayed on the screen is attached to a 
vertex formed by connecting vectors.\\

\newpage

%REQUIREMENT #5
\begin{reqbox}
%
\begin{tabular}{cc}
Requirement \#: 5 & Requirement Type: Functional \\
\end{tabular} \\
%
\textbf{Description:} The radius of each wheel must be at most \textit{r} units. 
\\
\textbf{Rationale:}  This requirement manages the complexity of the car model, 
allowing for realistic distribution of traits among members of a population. 
That is, cars with unrealistically sized wheels will not be generated.\\
\textbf{Originator:} Kelvin Lin\\
\textbf{Fit Criterion:} No cars generated will have wheels with a radius larger 
than \textit{r}.\\
%  
\textbf{Supporting Materials:} JavaScript \\
\textbf{History:} Created October 7\textsuperscript{th}, 2016

\end{reqbox}

%REQUIREMENT #6
\begin{reqbox}
%
\begin{tabular}{cc}
Requirement \#: 6 & Requirement Type: Functional \\
\end{tabular} \\
%
\textbf{Description:} The mass of each car must not be less than 
\textit{min\_weight}. \\
\textbf{Rationale:} In order to have realistic physical simulations of car 
models, the mass of the car must have a lower limit. The lower limit will 
guarantee the simulations to work as expected. \\
\textbf{Originator:} Kelvin Lin\\
\textbf{Fit Criterion:} The mass of any car models generated are greater than 
\textit{min\_weight}.\\
%  
\textbf{Supporting Materials:} JavaScript \\
\textbf{History:} Created October 10\textsuperscript{th}, 2016

\end{reqbox}

%REQUIREMENT #7
\begin{reqbox}
%
\begin{tabular}{cc}
Requirement \#: 7 & Requirement Type: Functional \\
\end{tabular} \\
%
\textbf{Description:} The mass of each car must not exceed \textit{max\_weight}. 
\\
\textbf{Rationale:} In order to have realistic physical simulations of car 
models, the mass of each car must have an upper limit. An upper limit reduces 
the possibility of type incompatibility with certain APIs. Additionally, it 
ensures that the mass of each car is encoded using a known number of bits.\\
\textbf{Originator:} Kelvin Lin\\
\textbf{Fit Criterion:} The mass of any car models generated do not exceed 
\textit{max\_weight}.\\

%REQUIREMENT #8
\begin{reqbox}
%
\begin{tabular}{cc}
Requirement \#: 8 & Requirement Type: Functional \\
\end{tabular} \\
%
\textbf{Description:} A car that stalls for more than \textit{max\_secs} shall 
be deemed non-moving. \\
\textbf{Rationale:} A time limit needs to be imposed on the simulations in order 
to prevent the cars from running indefinitely without making progress. \\
\textbf{Originator:} Kelvin Lin\\
\textbf{Fit Criterion:} All cars that say in the same spot for 
\textit{max\_secs} are marked as non-moving and the simulation for that car is 
stopped.\\
%  
\textbf{Supporting Materials:} JavaScript \\
\textbf{History:} Created October 10\textsuperscript{th}, 2016
%
\end{reqbox}

%REQUIREMENT #9
\begin{reqbox}
%
\begin{tabular}{cc}
Requirement \#: 9 & Requirement Type: Functional \\
\end{tabular} \\
%
\textbf{Description:} The fitness of a car shall not be calculated until a car 
is deemed to be non-moving. \\
\textbf{Rationale:} The fitness of a car is determined by distance it moves 
during the simulation, and the simulation runs while the car is moving. 
Therefore, the fitness of a car cannot be determined until the car is 
non-moving. \\
\textbf{Originator:} Kelvin Lin\\
\textbf{Fit Criterion:} After a car is deemed non-moving, it's fitness value can 
be assessed.\\

%REQUIREMENT #10
\begin{reqbox}
%
\begin{tabular}{cc}
Requirement \#: 10 & Requirement Type: Functional \\
\end{tabular} \\
%
\textbf{Description:} The program shall display each generation of cars 
traversing the road. \\
\textbf{Rationale:} The purpose of this program is to show its users the effects 
of genetic algorithms in an interesting and engaging manner. If the program did 
not display each generation of cars traversing the road, then the program would 
fail in accomplishing its original objective. \\
\textbf{Originator:} Kelvin Lin\\
\textbf{Fit Criterion:} Each generation of cars can be seen traversing a road on 
the medium of output.\\
%  
\textbf{Supporting Materials:} JavaScript \\
\textbf{History:} Created October 10\textsuperscript{th}, 2016

%REQUIREMENT #11
\begin{reqbox}
%
\begin{tabular}{cc}
Requirement \#: 11 & Requirement Type: Functional \\
\end{tabular} \\
%
\textbf{Description:} The program shall display the fitness of the top 
\textit{n} cars. \\
\textbf{Rationale:} The ability to compare the performance of cars during each 
generation is useful for observing the effects of genetic algorithms because it 
shows the users the improvement and regression of the car's performance over 
time.\\
\textbf{Originator:} Kelvin Lin\\
\textbf{Fit Criterion:} A medium of output exists to provide the fitness of the 
car on the medium of display.\\

\newpage

%REQUIREMENT #12
\begin{reqbox}
%
\begin{tabular}{cc}
Requirement \#: 12 & Requirement Type: Functional \\
\end{tabular} \\
%
\textbf{Description:} The program shall allow the user to enter a random seed to 
generate cars from in lieu of a randomly generated seed. \\
\textbf{Rationale:} The ability to enter a random seed allows the results of 
cars to be compared and to be run on multiple computers: results are not lost as 
a result of restarting the application. \\
\textbf{Originator:} Kelvin Lin\\
\textbf{Fit Criterion:} The user can input a random seed into the program 
through an input device, and the random seed is used to dictate the random 
behaviours of the program.\\
%  
\textbf{Supporting Materials:} JavaScript \\
\textbf{History:} Created October 10\textsuperscript{th}, 2016
%
\end{reqbox}

%REQUIREMENT #13
\begin{reqbox}
%
\begin{tabular}{cc}
Requirement \#: 13 & Requirement Type: Functional \\
\end{tabular} \\
%
\textbf{Description:} The user shall be allowed to modify the mutation rate, 
\textit{mutation\_rate}. \\
\textbf{Rationale:} Allowing the users to modify the mutation rate allows the 
program to fulfil its objective by showing the users how the mutation rate can 
impact the performance of the cars. \\
\textbf{Originator:} Kelvin Lin\\
\textbf{Fit Criterion:} The user can input a mutation rate into the program 
through an input device, and the mutation rate is used to produce offspring in 
the program.\\

\newpage

%REQUIREMENT #14
\begin{reqbox}
%
\begin{tabular}{cc}
Requirement \#: 14 & Requirement Type: Functional \\
\end{tabular} \\
%
\textbf{Description:} The user shall be allowed to change the number of cars per 
generation \textit{s} in lieu of the default value. \\
\textbf{Rationale:} Allowing the user to change the number of cars per 
generation \textit{s} will allow the user to see how the size of a generation 
affects the genetic algorithm. \\
\textbf{Originator:} Kelvin Lin\\
\textbf{Fit Criterion:} \textit{s} is equal to the user's input for every 
generation produced by the program.\\

%REQUIREMENT #15
\begin{reqbox}
%
\begin{tabular}{cc}
Requirement \#: 15 & Requirement Type: Functional \\
\end{tabular} \\
%
\textbf{Description:} The road generated must be the same across all 
generations. \\
\textbf{Rationale:} Using the same road for each generation allows for 
comparability of performance between each generation. That is, since every car 
will traverse the same course, their fitness and performance can be compared. \\
\textbf{Originator:} Kelvin Lin\\
\textbf{Fit Criterion:} The road for all simulations is the same. \\

Requirement \#: 16 & Requirement Type: Functional \\
\end{tabular} \\
%
\textbf{Description:} The number of cars per generation \textit{s} shall not 
exceed \textit{max\_cars\_per\_gen}. \\
\textbf{Rationale:} Having a maximum number of cars per generation prevents 
memory overflow from generating too many cars per generation.\\

\end{tabular} \\
%
\textbf{Description:} The program shall use the top \textit{t} cars to generate 
offsprings. \\
\textbf{Rationale:} The number of cars allowed to reproduce needs to be 
specified; otherwise, no improvement can be made in car performance over the

\textbf{Fit Criterion:} The parent cars of the offspring are within the top 
\textit{t} cars.\\

Requirement \#: 18 & Requirement Type: Functional \\
\end{tabular} \\
%
\textbf{Description:} The top \textit{t} cars shall not exceed \textit{t\_max}. 
\\
\textbf{Rationale:} This restriction prevents \textit{t} from exceeding 
\textit{s} or take on an unreasonable value. It ensures that the program can 
always run by setting an upper limit to the number of cars that can reproduce in 
a given generation. \\

first encounter with the product, a majority of representative users shall, 
without enticement, agree that they feel they would want to utilize the product 
and that they would learn about Genetic Algorithms by using the product. 
Representative users should also feel that they can trust the product.

\subsection{Usability and Humanity Requirements}

\subsubsection{Ease of Use Requirements}

The product shall be easy for anybody over the age of 6 to use. The product 
shall not expect the user to remember anything about the product given multiple 
uses. The product shall make the user want to use it and to show the product to 
their friends/family/etc.. The product shall be used by people with no training 
or education except for a basic knowledge of the English language and the most 
very basic functions of a computer, such as how to navigate to a web-site and 
how to enter inputs when prompted to do so. A representative sample of users 
shall be able to successfully complete a given set of tasks with the product 
within a specified period of time to be determined at the time of the sample. 
The representative sample shall also show a willingness to show the product to 
others.

\subsubsection{Personalization Requirements}

The product shall allow the user to make simple adjustments to the product to 
allow for a variable length and amount of trials depending on user input. 

\subsubsection{Learning Requirements}

The product shall be easy for an intended user of the product to learn. The 
product shall be able to be used by these users with no training before use. A 
representative sample of users shall be able to successfully complete a given 
set of tasks with the product within a specified period of time to be determined 
at the time of the sample.

\subsection{Performance Requirements}

\subsubsection{Speed and Latency Requirements}

The response time of the product shall be fast enough to avoid a loss of 
interest by the user following an input, which shall be a period of time no 
longer then five seconds. The initialization of the product shall be no longer 
then one minute.

\subsubsection{Maintenance Requirements}

\subsubsection{Supportability Requirements}

\subsubsection{Adaptability Requirements}

\subsection{Security Requirements}

\subsubsection{Access Requirements}

\subsubsection{Integrity Requirements}

\subsubsection{Privacy Requirements}

\subsection{Cultural Requirements}

\subsection{Legal Requirements}

\subsection{Health and Safety Requirements}

This section is not in the original Volere template, but health and safety are
issues that should be considered for every engineering project.

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}
Not applicable for this project.

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
Not applicable for this project.

\subsection{New Problems}
There is a risk that the copyright holder of Box Car 2D does not let anyone
 else use their codes anymore. In addition, if any developer in our group 
leave the group or drop the class in the future, this project will be 
difficult to implement since every developer is doing his own part and
 information will be gaped.

\subsection{Tasks}
Car modeling, Genetic algorithm design and graphics design will be doing 
concurrently and tested thoroughly. User interface will be designed after 
graphics done and project will be hosted on GitLab after codes implemented.

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
Not applicable for this project.

\subsection{Risks}
The Box2D API poses the most signiﬁcant risk for the car model. The Box2D 
API deﬁnes the car entity in terms that can be used with many physics 
equations, which is important for calculating the ﬁtness function of the 
car. In the event that the Box2D API proves to be infeasible for Team 8, 
alternate arrangements will have to be made in order to complete the
project: the team will resort to using basic kinematics equations to calculate 
the ﬁtness function instead of using the API. A possible drawback to this 
approach would be that the members of Team 8 are generally unfamiliar with 
Newtonian mechanics, so external assistance would be required. 

\subsection{Costs}
There will be no cost at all since all the software (Latex editor, code 
complier etc.) and web-hosting are free. 

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
The user documents will be simple and efficient for our project since this 
project will not ask the user to do many things. The main responsibility for 
training documentation is letting user familiar with the start button, reset 
button and output table.

\subsection{Waiting Room}
Audio effect is expected to be add to this project.

\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}
Good structure and design for this project.
