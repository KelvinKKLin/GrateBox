\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}

\subsubsection{Project Background}

Genetic algorithms serve as useful tools to search for near-optimal solutions to a wide variety of problems with incomplete or imperfect information by emulating the process of natural selection. The driving force for this project was the observed lack of genetic algorithm teaching tools. 

\subsubsection{Project Goals}

The primary goal of this project is to create a product that will teach users about the uses and theory behind genetic algorithms. The product must be engaging enough to maintain user interest while also bestowing them with practical knowledge about genetic algorithms. The success of this project will therefore be measured by both the engagement of the user and the increase in the user's practical knowledge of genetic algorithms.

\subsection{The Stakeholders}

\subsubsection{The Client}

The primary client of the Genetic Cars project is also the project's target audience, those with an academic interest in learning about genetic algorithms. This target audience is estimated to fall in the aged 16-24 student demographic. Since the Genetic Cars project does not have one formal client with whom to discuss the project's requirements, all project requirements are derived from the requirements of the project's target audience. These requirements were elicated via anonymous interviews with perspective users inititally, however long term testing and user feedback shall serve to further specify and clarify requirements.

\subsubsection{The Customers}

The customers for the Genetic Cars project are the users outlined above. Assumptions about these user are listed in section 1.5.1 of this document.

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}

Other stakeholders for this project include:\\

-Testers: Those individuals who will aid in the testing of our product, by filling out surveys and providing feedback on the project. Significant crossover with our target audience for obvious reasons. Will provide the primary means of communication with our customers for this reason.\\

-Third-party technology experts: Those individuals who will help Grate learn about the technologies necessary for this project, as outlined in the design document and during team meetings. While not officially members of Grate, their aid will proove invaluable to learning the technologies necessary for this project ot function, and they will be credited in final documentation.\\

-McMaster University library staff and faculty: Those individuals and services that will be interacted with to facilitate group meetings as outlined in the design document.

\subsection{Naming Conventions and Terminology}

Gene: A unit of heredity that is transferred from a parent to offspring and is held to determine some characteristic of the offspring.\\

Population: A community of animals, plants, or humans (or in this case cars) among whose members interbreeding occurs.\\

Sample: A portion drawn from a population, the study of which is intended to lead to statistical estimates of the attributes of the whole population.\\

Generation: The propagation of living organisms; procreation.\\

Trait: A genetically determined characteristic (i.e. the position of the wheels for one of the cars).\\

Attribute: Same as trait (used interchangeably with trait).\\

Mutate: To undergo or cause to undergo change in a gene or genes.\\

Mutation Rate: The rate at which mutations (seen above) occur.\\

Crossover: The exchange of genetic material between organism (or cars).\\

Reproduce: To produce one or more other individuals by means of genetic propogation.\\

\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}

\subsubsection{User Assumptions}

The user base for this product consists of those wishing to learn more about genetic algorithms. It is assumed that this demographic consists primarily of secondary school and post-secondary students aged 16-24. This demographic is assumed to be very familiar with software applications and especially web-based software applications. This demographic is also assumed to have some preliminary background in both secondary school level evolutionary biology and basic mathematics. Finally, the users of this product are assumed to possess a level of maturity required to appreciate the academic portions of the product.

\subsubsection{Other Assumptions}

Grate assumes that all software tools listed in the development document will be available for use throughout the project. It is also assumed that the physics library being used is fully complete, although this assumption will be tested thoroughly throughout the lifetime of this project.

	\textit{number\_of\_vertices} wheels. \\
	\textbf{Rationale:}  The wheels must be attached to the car via a vertex 
between 
	two connecting vectors. This requirement ensures that no redundant or unused 
	wheels will be generated.\\
	\textbf{Originator:} Kelvin Lin\\

	%
	\textbf{Description:} The center of each wheel generated must be attached to a 
	vertex formed by connecting vectors. \\
	\textbf{Rationale:}  Wheels cannot be floating on or around the car. This 
	requirement ensures visual coherency by requiring wheels to be attached to the 
	car model. Knowing the center of the wheel will also allow the physics engine 
to 
	calculate the torque and distance that the car travelled.\\

\textit{max\_weight}. 
	\\
	\textbf{Rationale:} In order to have realistic physical simulations of car 
	models, the mass of each car must have an upper limit. An upper limit reduces 
	the possibility of type incompatibility with certain APIs. Additionally, it 
	ensures that the mass of each car is encoded using a known number of bits.\\

\subsection{Legal Requirements}

The Genetic Cars project does not possess any legal requirements of note as licensing is a non-issue for this project.

\subsection{Health and Safety Requirements}

The Genetic Cars project does not possess any Health and Safety requirements of note beyond those that would be expected of any software program.
\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}
Not applicable for this project.

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}

\subsubsection{Ready-Made Product}
Similar solutions to Grate's Genetic Cars already exists, notably BoxCar2D 
(boxcar2d.com/) and Rednuht's Genetic Cars (rednuht.org/genetic\_cars\_2/). Both 
products demonstrate the effect of genetic algorithms through evolving cars by 
selecting for the longest distance travel. They differ in that BoxCar2D displays 
one car at a time, whereas Rednuht's Genetic Cars displays all of the cars in 
one generation at once. They both allow users to adjust parameters of the 
genetic algorithm in order to observe the effects of the algorithm. They both 
show the performance of the cars over time.

\subsubsection{Reusable Components}
The Box2D API and the D3 API can both be reused in Grate's Genetic Cars. The 
Box2D API provides functionality such as Vectors and Polygons that can be used 
to model the car. The D3 API provides visualization functionality that can be 
used to visualize the performance of cars over time. These APIs provide 
functionality external to the core functionality of Grate's Genetic Cars, which 
will make them valuable assets as Grate will not have to reimplement these APIs.

\subsubsection{Products That Can Be Copied}
Rednuht's Genetic Cars is licensed under the author's custom license which 
grants others the right to reuse his code as part of their solution. 
Furthermore, both BoxCar2D and Rednuht's Genetic Cars have released their 
algorithms in some form: BoxCar2D through visuals and text, and Rednuht's 
Genetic Cars through source code. Grate's Genetic Cars can draw inspiration from 
these sources in implementing a new innovative solution to teaching genetic 
algorithms.

\subsection{New Problems}

\subsubsection{Effects on the Current Environment}

\subsubsection{Potential User Problems}
Users may experience fatigue from prolong use of the product. Symptoms of 
fatigue can include eyestrain, dizziness, nausea, muscle pain, or general 
discomfort. To prevent fatigue, users should take periodic breaks when using the 
program for prolonged periods of time. However, fatigue should not pose a 
significant risk for this project, as the target audience for Grate's Genetic 
Cars is older teenagers and adults who have prior experience using computers and 
are  knowledgeable about the health concerns associated with prolong use of 
computers.

Users with epilepsy or prior history of seizures may also experience seizures or 
blackouts while using the product. Symptoms of seizures may include convulsions, 
eye or muscle twitching, loss of awareness, altered vision, involuntary 
movements, and disorientation. However, this risk is not significant as the risk 
of having a seizure from light flashes or patterns is low (about 1 in 4000), and 
the likelihood of experiencing a seizure can be reduced through simple steps. 
Users can reduce the risk of experience seizures while using the product if they 
sit or stand away from the screen, use the smallest screen possible, use the 
product in a well lit room, take frequent breaks, and refrain from using the 
product if tired.

\subsubsection{Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation Environment that 
May Inhibit the New Product}
Not applicable for this project.

\subsubsection{Follow-up Problems}
The implementation environment may become depreciated before the completion of 
the project, and the platforms the product is built for may no longer support 
the product after completion of implementation. This is a significant risk as 
modern programming languages and operating platforms are constantly evolving; 
however, this risk can be mitigated through writing maintainable code that can 
be converted to new standards as they arise.

\subsection{Tasks}
\subsubsection{Project Planning}
The V-Model of Software Development will be used in the development of this 
project. The V-Model to be followed is depicted below:

%The following figure was adapted from Dr. Smith's Lecture 5 Slides, available 
%at https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/smiths/se3xa3/tree/master/Lectures/05-TestPlan
\begin{figure}[H]
  \includegraphics[scale=0.74]{OverviewOfProcess.pdf}
  \caption{The V-Model of Software Development}
\end{figure}

Grate is dedicated to writing high quality code through the application of 
strong software engineering principles. In order to meet that standard, the 
project will begin separated into 3 main stages. First, an extensive design and 
documentation phase before any part of the system is implemented. Once the 
project has been designed, then coding can commence. At the conclusion of 
coding, there will be an extensive testing and validation phase in order to 
build confidence in the functionality of the final product. The total time 
anticipated for this project is 4 months.

The design phase contains 6 deliverables: the problem statement, the development 
plan, the requirements specifications, the verification and validation plan, and 
the design specification. Creating the problem statement and the development 
plan should both take about 1 week. Creating the requirements specification, the 
verification and validation plan, and the design specification will all take 
about 2 weeks.

The coding phase involves implementing the project following the design 
specifications. The implementation of the project will take about 3 weeks.

Verification and Validation involves testing the project following the 
Verification and Validation Plan. The verification and validation of the project 
will take about 2 weeks.

Note that, despite the arrows in the diagram, this is an iterative process. This 
means that processes can happen more than once during the development process, 
with each iteration making improvements upon the previous iteration. Steps can 
also be skipped within iterations, or be performed out of order if deemed 
necessary. 

\subsubsection{Planning of the Development Phases}
Not applicable for this project.

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
Not applicable for this project.

\subsection{Risks}
The Box2D API poses the most signiﬁcant risk for the car model. The Box2D 
API deﬁnes the car entity in terms that can be used with many physics 
equations, which is important for calculating the ﬁtness function of the 
car. In the event that the Box2D API proves to be infeasible for Team 8, 
alternate arrangements will have to be made in order to complete the
project: the team will resort to using basic kinematics equations to calculate 
the ﬁtness function instead of using the API. A possible drawback to this 
approach would be that the members of Team 8 are generally unfamiliar with 
Newtonian mechanics, so external assistance would be required. 

\subsection{Costs}
There will be no cost at all as all of the materials used will be free.

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}

\subsubsection{User Documentation Requirements}
The following documents will be created for Grate's Genetic Cars:

\begin{enumerate}

\item{User Manual}

The user manual will detail the operation procedures for Grate's Genetic Cars.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Training Requirements}

\subsection{Waiting Room}
Audio effect is expected to be add to this project.

\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}
Good structure and design for this project.
