\section{General Information}

\subsection{Purpose}

The purpose of this project's testing is to affirm that all requirements 
outlined in the Requirements Specifications document have been met and that the 
Genetic Cars software was implemented properly.

\subsection{Scope}

This test plan presents a basis for the testing of software functionality. It 
has the objectives of proving that the Genetic Cars project has met all the 
requirements outlined in the Requirements Specification document and of 
attaching metrics to those requirements for the sake of quantifying them. It 
also serves as a means to arrange testing activities. It will present what is to 
be tested and will act as an outline for testing methods and tools to be 
utilized.

\subsection{Overview of Document}

The Genetic Cars project will re-implement the code of the open source project 
BoxCar2D. The software's requirements are outlined in the Requirements 
Specifications document.

\section{Plan}
	
\subsection{Software Description}

The software will allow users to model and learn about genetic algorithms in a 
fun and educational way. The implementation will be completed in JavaScript.

\subsection{Test Team}

The individuals responsible for the testing of this project are  Kelvin Lin, 
Eric Chaput, and  Jin Liu. Jin Liu is in charge of testing for functional 
requirements. Eric Chaput is in charge of testing for non-functional 
requirements and for surveying representative users for feedback and testing 
purposes. Kelvin Lin as team leader shall oversee time management for testing 
but will otherwise take no direct role in the testing process.

\subsection{Automated Testing Approach}

QUnit will be the primary tool used for testing this project. It will be used to 
automate unit testing. JavaScript also supports the principle of self-testing so 
many automated tests through JavaScript itself will also be viable.

\subsection{Testing Tools}

QUnit will be the primary tool used for testing this project. It will be used to 
automate unit testing. All group members are familiar with QUnit's Java 
equivalent, JUnit, and so minimal instruction in QUnit will be necessary. 
Testing will also be conducted in JavaScript itself as there are many testing 
methods native to JavaScript itself. Expected code coverage is 80 percent for this project.
\textcolor{red}{Expected knowledge of J/Qunit, browsers, code coverage... etc. - CM} \\

Initial State: Program has been run but no additional inputs have been made.
					
Input: Creation of a car. Set random seed.
					
Output: Complete car object with random values that correspond with the given 
random seed. 100 percent match with estimated car and car values.
					
How test will be performed: Unit test will be set with a random seed and 
instructed to create 100 different cars given this seed. Final cars will then be 
compared to estimated cars. Test will be considered a success if generated cars 
are a 100 percent match to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 10th, and 50th cars estimated 
given the random seed. Test used to determine Q-Unit limitations on preset 
mathematical formulas.
					
\item{UC-2\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Automated
					
Initial State: Program has created several cars as in test case UC-1 but no 
additional instructions have been given.
					
Input: Several pre made cars with non-random values.
					
Output: A new generation of cars created by mutating and crossing the generation 
of cars given.
					
How test will be performed: Mutation factor will be set to 10 percent. Final 
generation of cars will be estimated given the mutation factor and the pre 
generated cars. Final generation of cars will be generated using Q-Unit. Test 
will be considered a success if generated cars are a 100 percent match to the 
1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 10th, and 50th cars estimated. Test used to determine Q-Unit 
limitations on random generation.

\subsection{Graphics}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{UG-1\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic Automated
					
Initial State: Program open and running with generation of cars generated as in 
UC-1.
					
Input: Run simulation for the generation of cars. Predetermined graphical 
representation of simulation for comparison.
					
Output: Graphic representation of generation of cars for comparison to 
predetermined graphical representation.
					
How test will be performed: Generation of cars given will give estimated 
graphical output for 30 frames. Generation of cars given will be run through the 
program's graphics engine. 1st, 2nd, 12th, and 30th, frames. Comparison will be 
drawn using JavaScript in built image comparison. Test will be considered a 
success if 95 percent similarity reached. Test used to see Q-Unit limitations on 
a graphical level.

\end{enumerate}
	
\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	
There are is one test that compares the program to the Existing Implementation 
of the program please refer to test GR 1.1 in Tests for Functional Requirements 
- Graphics. Non-functional comparison is to be conducted through the user survey.
				
\section{Unit Testing Plan}

Unit testing will be conducted using the QUnit software outlined in the 
development document.
		
\subsection{Unit testing of internal functions}

In order to create unit tests for the internal functions of the program certain 
methods that return values
can be tested. This will involve taking the methods and giving them input 
values. Given what they are
supposed to output and that they actually output a series of unit tests can be 
created. Unit tests will include
tests that contain proper inputs and inputs that generate exceptions.  Anything 
that needs to be imported will already be done
by the individual classes. We will be using coverage metrics to determine how 
much of our code we have
covered. Our goal is to cover as much as possible in order to make sure that we 
test all functions adequately.
Our goal percentage to beat will be 85 percent.
		
\subsection{Unit testing of output files}		

Our program generates two primary outputs, the technical output generated by the 
genetic algorithms, and the graphical output displayed to the user. The genetic 
algorithms can be unit tested as explained above in the "Unit testing of 
internal functions" section. Graphical output will be harder to unit test, 
however Grate is looking into the prospect of pre generating expected graphical 
outcomes with given inputs and comparing those to the graphical outputs 
generated by the GC project. These images can then be compared by a unit test by 
percentage similarity. Currently the threshold for percentage similarity stands 
at 95 percent.

\subsection{Usability Survey Questions?}
Note that many of the given survey questions may not pertain to a particular 
test case and are present in the survey so that users may give potentially 
valuable input that the testing team has not thought to request of them. This 
survey shall be reformatted and placed on Google Docs at a later date.

1. How would you rate the "visual aesthetic" of this program? (i.e. Were the 
various elements of the user interface understandable, was it visually 
appealing)

- Favourable

- No opinion

- Unfavourable

2. How would you rate the "style" of this program? (i.e. Was the program 
professional enough, was it inviting enough,  do you feel you can you trust the 
product)

- Favourable

- No opinion

- Unfavourable

3. How would you rate the "usability" of this program? (i.e. Were the various 
functions obvious at first sight, did the program give the feedback you needed, 
was it a hassle to install/access online)
- Favourable

- No opinion

- Unfavourable

4. How would you rate the "speed" of the program? (i.e Did you have to wait 
while the program loaded or performed functions, did the program run smoothly 
throughout, did you experience choppiness)

- Favourable

- No opinion

- Unfavourable

5. How would you rate the "accuracy" of the program? (i.e Did you feel the 
program displayed a valid interpretation of genetic algorithms based on your 
understanding of them, was the program mathematically sound from what you could 
see)

- Unfavourable

6. How would you rate your overall user experiance with the Genetic Cars 
application?
