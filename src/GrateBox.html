         <h3>What is a Genetic Algorithm?</h3>

         Genetic algorithms (GAs) search for near-optimal solutions to a wide variety of
         problems with incomplete or imperfect information by emulating the process of
         natural selection. As the algorithm is used, the solution will be more and more optimized. They are well suited to solving open ended problems with a variety of possible solutions. Applications of genetic algorithms include automated design,
         bioinformatics, economics, game theory, and training neural networks.

         <h3>What is this program's purpose?</h3>

         Presented here is an application of genetic algorithms. This program will randomly
         generate an initial car with a polygon body and two wheels randomly placed. Observe
         how the car evolves towards a more successful iteration to move farther and farther
         along the road.

         <h3>How performance is calculated</h3>

         Under the <b>Results </b> heading, you will see that the best car of each generation is displayed with a corresponding value giving its "cycles". Each car possesses a health value to determine if it is still moving. As the car moves, a thread is constantly running to check the car's speed. If the car is not making forwards advancement the health of the car decreases. When the car's health reaches zero it is determined to be dead, and the number of times the thread cycled is recorded as the number of cycles. The greater the amount of cycles, the better performing the car is.

         <h3>GitHub</h3>

         The full code and documentation for the Genetic Cars project can be found on a
          <a href = "https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/linkk4/GrateBox">Github repository</a>.
